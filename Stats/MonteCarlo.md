# Probabilistic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods.

Again, the book [*Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers*](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) is a great free resource to start with if you want to get your hands dirty quickly.

- [Markov Chain Monte Carlo & Gibbs Sampling](http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB596/handouts/Gibbs.pdf)

   Lecture notes. A mathy but readable description of MCMC methods and Gibb's sampling as a way of sampling the posterior distribution in for use in Bayesian approaches.

- [Marketing Analytics through Markov Chain](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/marketing-analytics-through-markov-chain)

   Simple example of building a Markov Chain using a transition matrix supposed to represent customer states... *e.g.* did they make a purchase, were they aware of marketing campaign... etc.

- [Understanding Monte Carlo Simulation](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-monte-carlo-simulation-eceb4c9cad4)

   Examples (with Python code) showing how to use Monte Carlo methods to sample from a distribution and also integrate a function, but for 1D numerical integrations, you may be better off using [quadrature rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration#Methods_for_one-dimensional_integrals) in my opinion.

- [A Zero-Math Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50)

   Does what it says on the tin. Good for building intuition about MCMC does.

- [Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without all the Bullshit](https://jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/)

   A basic description of MCMC methods using minimal jargon and some math but not lots of math.

## Videos & Presentations

- [An introduction to Gibbs sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER3DDBFzH2g)

   This video is part of a lecture course which closely follows the material covered in the book, "A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics." Uses a bivariate discrete probability distribution example to illustrate how Gibbs sampling works in practice.

- [Introduction to Gibbs Sampling](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/modern_bayes17/lecturesModernBayes17/lecture-7/07-gibbs.pdf)

   Slides from Duke's STA 360 course: *Bayesian Methods and Modern Statistics* I'm not a big fan of slides without hearing the presentation, but they look readable. Covers Gibb's sampling with the following distributions as examples: exponential, normal, and pareto.

- [Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the Metropolis Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1NOS_wxgGg)

   Youtube: An introduction to the intuition of MCMC and implementation of the Metropolis algorithm. (*35 minutes*)

- [MCMC: Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyG5DVigEyM)

   A youtube lecture describing MCMC (*20 minutes*)
