# Model Selection

Ways of telling which model better suits the data.

- [Model Selection and Evaluation: Goodness of fit and likelihood ratio tests](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su08/lecturenotes/rao_model08.pdf), C.R. Rao

   Lecture notes from summer school in statistics for astronomers and physicist. Pretty mathy without much plain english explanation.

- [A unified approach to model selection using the likelihood ratio test](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00063.x)
   Academic paper from Methods in Ecology and Evolution. Open Access.

- [FAQ: How are the likelihood ratio, Wald, and Lagrange multiplier (score) tests different and/or similar?](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-are-the-likelihood-ratio-wald-and-lagrange-multiplier-score-tests-different-andor-similar/)

   This page introduces the concepts of the a) likelihood ratio test, b) Wald test, and c) score test. Very little math, mostly explanations and graphs.
